Noir is developed with the goal of enabling security engineers and pentesters to easily identify endpoints in source code. 

It serves as an Attack Surface Detector, conducting static analysis on the source code and various files within the target directory to identify endpoints such as URLs, headers, and parameters. This facilitates the easy identification of endpoints within source code, enabling the transmission of results to other tools or parsing for integration with DAST or logging systems in a DevSecOps environment.
